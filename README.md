# DS-M2-Capstone-Project

## Introduction
For this project, I worked with a [Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators) containing healthcare statistics and lifestyle survey information about people in general along with their diagnosis of diabetes.

**The objective is is to create a model that is able to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, is pre-diabetic, or healthy**

Steps :
1. EDA
2. Data Visualization
3. Data analysis : I chose to apply a logistic regression model and a radom forest
4. Choose the final model and make a prediction
